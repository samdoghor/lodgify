# Lodgify Frontend

The frontend for the Lodgify project is built using Vite, React, and JavaScript. This repository contains the codebase for the user interface of Lodgify.

## Installation

Before getting started, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [NodeJs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To install the dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

```Copy code
npm install
```

## Running the app

To start the development server, run the following command in the terminal:

```Copy code
npm run dev
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://localhost:5173/`. It doesn't really matter.

## Building the app

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```Copy code
npm run build
```

This will create a dist folder with the optimized build of the app.
